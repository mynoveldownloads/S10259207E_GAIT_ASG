## Question 1 [Difficulty: Easy] [Type: Multiple Choice]

**Question:**  
What is the main reason the Azraq PC250 server requires Linux rather than Windows for stable operation?

A) Linux uses fewer system resources.  
B) Windows has proprietary drivers that are not publicly available.  
C) Linux automatically splits memory between CPU and GPU.  
D) Windows cannot boot from USB on the PC250.

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Explanation:**  
The article states that all AMD APU drivers are open‑source and integrated into the Linux kernel starting with version 4.12, whereas Windows drivers are proprietary, unavailable, or unstable. Therefore, Linux is essential.  
- **A)** Not the core issue; resource usage is separate.  
- **C)** Dynamic memory is configured via BIOS, not automatically by Linux.  
- **D)** The boot method is not the problem.

## Question 2 [Difficulty: Medium] [Type: True/False]

**Question:**  
The original BIOS of the BC250 node fixed the memory split at 8 GB for CPU and 10 GB for GPU, and this split could be changed at boot time without additional tools.

**Correct Answer:** False  

**Explanation:**  
The original BIOS has fixed splits (8/10 GB or 6/10 GB) and cannot be altered at boot or via drivers. The "Crucial Insight" section explains that a modified BIOS is required to allow dynamic memory from 1 GB to 12 GB.  
- The statement incorrectly claims dynamic change at boot, which is impossible without the BIOS mod.

## Question 3 [Difficulty: Medium] [Type: Short Answer]

**Question:**  
List two benefits of configuring the BC250’s GPU governor script `gpupower --auto`.

**Correct Answer:**  
1) It reduces idle power consumption from ~100 W to ~40–45 W by down‑clocking the GPU.  
2) It maintains performance when the GPU is active while saving energy during idle periods.

**Explanation:**  
The power‑management section notes that the original idle draw is high due to the GPU clock. Adding the governor lowers idle wattage and allows dynamic scaling, improving efficiency without hindering active workloads.

## Question 4 [Difficulty: Hard] [Type: Application]

**Question:**  
You want to host a LAN party with 12 simultaneous players at 1080 p each, but observe that the overall chassis noise is too high due to the 580 mm front fans. Which fan‑swap strategy would best balance acoustic goals and cooling performance, and why?

A) Keep the 580 mm fans but set a lower throttle curve in BIOS.  
B) Replace the 580 mm fans with larger 200 mm units to increase airflow.  
C) Replace the 580 mm fans with 120 mm units and install 3D‑printed airflow guides.  
D) Remove all front fans and rely on passive cooling.

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Explanation:**  
Option C achieves lower noise: 120 mm fans have smaller blades, often operate at lower RPMs for the same airflow, thus reducing decibel levels. Adding airflow guides or baffles improves channeling, maintaining effective cooling.  
- **A)** Lowering a throttle curve may reduce noise but also reduces airflow, risking overheating.  
- **B)** Larger 200 mm units would actually increase noise and may not be compatible with the chassis.  
- **D)** Passive cooling would be insufficient for the heat generated by 12 active nodes.

## Question 5 [Difficulty: Easy] [Type: Multiple Choice]

**Question:**  
Which distribution is specifically pre‑configured for gaming on the Azraq PC250 and includes Steam, Lutris, and Sunshine?

A) Fedora  
B) Arch Linux  
C) Bazaight  
D) Ubuntu

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Explanation:**  
The “Recommended Distributions” section lists Bazaight as pre‑configured for gaming with those packages.  
- Fedora and Arch are general distributions; Ubuntu is not mentioned.

## Question 6 [Difficulty: Medium] [Type: Multiple Choice]

**Question:**  
If a successful RDNA‑2 hardware encoder is added to the BC250, which of the following is the most direct benefit?

A) The GPU will now support 3D rendering at 8K resolution.  
B) The CPU encoding load for game streaming will decrease, freeing CPU cycles.  
C) The node will no longer need dynamic RAM configuration.  
D) The GPU governor script will run without Linux.

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Explanation:**  
Hardware encoding offloads H.264/H.265 compression from the CPU to the GPU, reducing CPU usage (~12 % currently).  
- **A)** The encoder does not affect rendering resolution.  
- **C)** Dynamic RAM is unrelated to the encoder.  
- **D)** The governor script remains a CPU‑side tool.

## Question 7 [Difficulty: Hard] [Type: Short Answer]

**Question:**  
Explain why the modified BIOS allows a memory split of 512 MB between CPU and GPU. What functional advantage does this low split provide for cloud gaming?

**Correct Answer:**  
The 512 MB split makes the memory pool effectively dynamic; the operating system can allocate memory on demand between CPU and GPU as workloads change. In cloud gaming, this flexibility allows the OS to give GPU the bulk of memory for rendering while reserving a small share for CPU tasks, improving overall throughput and reducing memory fragmentation.

**Explanation:**  
The BIOS modification lets the memory be split from 1 GB to 12 GB, and a 512 MB split forces the OS to handle allocation “on the fly.” This is especially useful for streaming, where memory requirements fluctuate between frames.

## Question 8 [Difficulty: Easy] [Type: True/False]

**Question:**  
After flashing the updated BIOS, a full BIOS reset can be performed simply by power‑cycling the chassis.

**Correct Answer:** False  

**Explanation:**  
A “full BIOS reset” requires toggling the CMOS pins next to the battery, not just power‑cycling. The flashing procedure explicitly states this step, reflecting the need to clear previous BIOS settings.

## Question 9 [Difficulty: Medium] [Type: Multiple Choice]

**Question:**  
Which statement best describes the performance relationship between a single BC250 node and modern mobile GPUs, according to the article?

A) A BC250 node is significantly weaker than an RX‑6600.  
B) A BC250 node roughly matches a modern mobile RX‑6600.  
C) A BC250 node outperforms all desktop GPUs.  
D) A BC250 node cannot handle 1080p gaming at 60 fps.

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Explanation:**  
The “Crucial Insight” section explicitly says a single BC250 node is roughly on par with a modern mobile RX‑6600.  
- **A)** Incorrect comparative claim.  
- **C)** Overstates performance.  
- **D)** Contradicts listed real‑game benchmarks.

## Question 10 [Difficulty: Hard] [Type: Application]

**Question:**  
You are tasked with designing a cluster of 12 BC250 nodes to stream 1080p/60fps content to 12 users simultaneously. Discuss the primary hardware, software, and power-optimization steps you would take to keep the cluster within a budget of \$12 000 (including power costs) and under 35 dB of static noise.

**Correct Answer:**  
1. **Hardware** – Use refurbished 12‑node chassis purchased at ~\$20.83 per node. Replace all 580 mm front fans with 120 mm units and install 3D‑printed airflow guides to reduce noise.  
2. **Software** – Install Bazaight for pre‑configured gaming; enable Sunshine for streaming; apply the `gpupower --auto` governor to reduce idle draw.  
3. **Dynamic Memory** – Flash the modified BIOS to set a 512 MB split, allowing the OS to balance GPU/CPU memory dynamically.  
4. **Encoding** – Optimize Sunshine to use CPU encoding at 12 % CPU load; if a GPU encoder patch becomes available, switch to GPU encoding to further reduce CPU use.  
5. **Power** – After the governor, idle consumption drops to ~40 W per node; during 60 fps streaming per node it remains below 60 W. Thus, a 12‑node cluster uses ~480 W continuously, fitting within typical data‑center budgets.  
6. **Noise** – 120 mm fans with lower RPM plus baffles reduce decibel levels below 35 dB; verify with a decibel meter during idle and peak loads.  

**Explanation:**  
Combining low‑cost hardware, community BIOS, Linux software tuned for streaming, dynamic memory, and aggressive power management keeps the cluster cheap, energy‑efficient, and quiet, meeting the specified constraints.
