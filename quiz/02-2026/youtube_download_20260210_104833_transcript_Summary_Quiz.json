        "C": "Potential issues in operational efficiency, financial management, or strategic focus.",
        "D": "The limited range of AI models they have developed."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The text states that Jensen Huang reportedly criticized OpenAI for a 'lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach.' While not explicitly defined, this phrase commonly refers to operational efficiency, financial management, or strategic clarity in business contexts.",

      "options": {
        "A": "It suggests that the deal is progressing smoothly without further complications.",
        "B": "It implies that repeated assurances about the deal's lack of issues might indicate underlying complexities.",
        "C": "It highlights the importance of clear, concise communication in large financial agreements.",
        "D": "It serves as a direct financial disclaimer regarding the $100 billion figure."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The quote, 'The first sign that there's drama is when someone has to tell you twice that there's no drama,' is used to 'aptly capture the sentiment surrounding the NVIDIA-OpenAI deal.'
