  "total_questions": 5,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Why does the Singapore AI Governance Framework emphasize the use of high\u2011quality, representative data during the data preparation phase?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To speed up the training process by reducing data volume.",
        "B": "To ensure that synthetic data generated by the model faithfully mirrors the characteristics of the real data.",
        "C": "To comply with open\u2011source licensing requirements.",
        "D": "To avoid the need for model validation later in the pipeline."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The framework stresses high\u2011quality, representative data because biases or gaps in the training set can be amplified in synthetic outputs, undermining trust and safety. Representative data ensures that the generative model learns the true distribution, leading to more reliable synthetic data and reducing the risk of unfair or inaccurate generation.",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In the provided PyTorch data loading example, why is the normalization step with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.5 applied to the MNIST images?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To convert the pixel values to a binary format.",
        "B": "To center the pixel values around zero, stabilising gradient updates during training.",
        "C": "To make the images appear more colorful.",
        "D": "To ensure compatibility with older versions of PyTorch."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Normalizing each pixel value to have zero mean and unit variance (here, centering around zero with a scaling of 0.5) prevents large input values from causing exploding gradients and helps maintain consistent activation scales across layers, which stabilises the optimisation process and speeds up convergence.",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the primary role of the batch\u2011norm layer in the generator architecture described in the diagram?",
      "options": {
        "A": "To upscale the image resolution during upsampling.",
        "B": "To reduce the dimensionality of the latent noise vector.",
        "C": "To normalise activations across the mini\u2011batch, improving training stability.",
        "D": "To apply a non\u2011linear activation function to the output."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Batch\u2011norm normalises the activations at each layer across a mini\u2011batch, controlling internal covariate shift. This stabilises gradients, allows for higher learning rates, and accelerates convergence, which is especially useful in deep generative networks.",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "How does the generator component in a generative adversarial network produce synthetic data from random noise?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It directly samples random noise and labels it as real data without any transformation.",
        "B": "It learns a mapping from a latent noise vector to the distribution of real data through adversarial training.",
        "C": "It clones existing real data samples and adds random noise afterward.",
        "D": "It requires a pre\u2011trained discriminator to generate data directly from labels."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The generator learns parameters that map a latent noise vector to a data sample that matches the real data distribution, guided by feedback from the discriminator. It does not merely copy data but synthesises new instances that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real ones.",
      "difficulty": "hard"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following statements is NOT an assumption made by the framework\u2019s running environment?",
      "options": {
        "A": "AI systems are developed with transparency and accountability.",
        "B": "Data is managed responsibly and ethically.",
        "C": "Only government and healthcare sectors implement the framework.",
        "D": "Public trust is maintained through clear communication and provenance."
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The framework explicitly states that it is designed for a wide range of sectors\u2014government, healthcare, finance, education, media\u2014emphasising a collaborative ecosystem. It does not limit application to only government and healthcare.",
      "difficulty": "easy"
