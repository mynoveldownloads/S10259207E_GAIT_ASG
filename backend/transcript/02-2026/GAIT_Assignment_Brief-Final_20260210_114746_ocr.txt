1. OBJECTIVE    
The objective of this capstone project is to assess your ability to conceptualise, design, 
develop, and deploy a functional Generative AI-powered system by applying the tools, 
models, and techniques learned throughout the module. 
Through this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to: 
• 
Apply Generative AI concepts in a practical context 
• 
Design effective prompts and AI workflows 
• 
Integrate Generative AI across two or more modalities (eg. text, image, video, 
audio, code etc.) 
• 
Translate AI capabilities into a usable application or tool 
• 
Evaluate ethical considerations and limitations of Generative AI systems 
This assignment represents a culmination of your learning, moving from 
experimentation with AI tools to building a purposeful, working solution. 
 
2. SCOPE 
This is an individual assignment. You are responsible for the end-to-end design, 
development, and deployment of your solution. 
Your project must: 
• 
Address one clearly defined user problem 
• 
Be designed for one primary target user persona 
• 
Focus on one main application workflow 
• 
Result in a working and demo-able system 
You are expected to keep the scope focused and realistic.  
Mandatory Gen AI Scope: 
1. Text-based Generative AI (LLM) – mandatory 
2. ONE additional Generative AI modality (choose one or more): 
o 
Image generation 
o 
Audio / voice generation 
o 
Video / avatar generation 
o 
Code generation 
3. Application logic beyond a single prompt (e.g. multi-step workflow, prompt 
chaining, or conditional logic) 
4. Deployment (can be local and/or remote) as a usable application or tool

Marking Rubrics 
Component 
Marks 
Excellent 
Good 
Satisfactory 
Needs Improvement 
Problem 
Definition & Use 
Case 
15 
(12-15 marks) 
Problem is highly 
relevant, specific, and 
clearly articulated. The 
use of GenAI is innovative 
and provides a distinct 
advantage over traditional 
solutions. Target user is 
well-defined and the 
solution is perfectly 
aligned with their needs. 
(9-11 marks) 
Problem is relevant and 
clearly stated. The use of 
GenAI is appropriate. 
Target user is defined and 
the solution addresses 
their needs. 
(6-8 marks) 
Problem is somewhat 
generic or lacks a clear 
user focus. The use of 
GenAI is functional but 
not particularly 
advantageous. Solution 
is loosely connected to 
user needs. 
(0-5 marks) 
Problem is unclear, 
irrelevant, or poorly 
defined. The use of 
GenAI is inappropriate 
or trivial. No clear user 
or problem is identified. 
Prompt

structured and effective. 
The AI workflow is 
functional and logical. The 
system architecture is clear 
and appropriate for the 
task. 
(12-17 marks) 
Prompts are functional 
but basic. The AI 
workflow is simple and 
may not be robust. The 
system architecture is

constructed and 
ineffective. The AI 
workflow is illogical, 
broken, or non-existent. 
The system 
architecture is missing 
or fundamentally 
flawed. 
Technical 
Implementation 
30 
(24-30 marks) 
The application is fully 
functional, stable, and 
deployed correctly. Both 
AI modalities are 
seamlessly integrated. 
The user interface is 
(18-23 marks) 
The application is 
functional with minor bugs. 
Both AI modalities are 
integrated. The user 
interface is usable but may 
lack polish. 
(12-17 marks) 
The core application 
works but may be 
unstable or have 
significant bugs. 
Modality integration is 
incomplete or clumsy. 
(0-11 marks) 
The application is non-
functional or fails to run. 
Required AI modalities 
are not integrated. The 
user interface is 
missing or unusable.

The user interface is 
difficult to use. 
Ethics, 
Reflection & 
Limitations

insightful reflection on the 
project's limitations and 
challenges. Demonstrates 
a mature understanding of 
responsible AI 
development. 
(6-7 marks) 
Identifies relevant ethical 
issues and discusses the 
project's limitations. 
Reflection is thoughtful and 
demonstrates learning. 
(4-5 marks) 
Briefly mentions ethical 
issues and limitations 
but lacks depth or 
critical analysis. 
Reflection is superficial. 
(0-3 marks) 
Fails to address ethical 
issues or limitations.

questions. 
(9-11 marks) 
Explanation is clear and 
the live demo is 
successful. Able to answer 
most questions correctly. 
(6-8 marks) 
Explanation is 
somewhat unclear or 
disorganized. The 
demo may have 
technical issues.
